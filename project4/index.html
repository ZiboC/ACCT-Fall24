                <h1>Project Overview</h1>
                <p>In this project I developed a web-based application designed to create personalized travel itineraries for users. At its core is an interactive assistant, Alex the Explorer, who engages users in a dynamic survey to collect travel preferences such as destination, dates, budget, and travel style. Based on these inputs, the assistant generates customized itineraries with varying levels of detail, leveraging the power of the OpenAI API. Users can select from three levels of detail—Brief, Standard, and Detailed—with each level offering progressively more specific schedules, including daily activities, restaurant recommendations, and transportation suggestions.</p>
